# 🚀 Job Portal Website

A simple job portal website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a list of available job positions for users to find and a feature that allows them to bookmark jobs they like. The job details are stored in a remote API and include user authentication.

This project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient job search platform, making it easier for job seekers to discover and apply for suitable positions. The website offers a clean and modern interface, allowing users to browse through job listings, view detailed job descriptions, and save their favorite job postings for future reference.
